# 0x00. Python - Hello, World
This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about variables, basic commands (print) and handle strings with **Python**.

## Technologies
* Used 'vi' as editor
* All files compiled & tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5) for Python files and gcc (using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89) for C files
* Used pycodestyle version '2.8.*'  for Python and Betty style for C
