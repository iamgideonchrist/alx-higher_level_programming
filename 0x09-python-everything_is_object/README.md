This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), mutability, identity, and data types in **Python**.


## Apparatus
* Used `vi` as editor
* All files compiled & tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* Used the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)

## Files

All `.txt` files store the answers to the questions.
