# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn about object-oriented programming (OOP), Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, instances, and class attributes in **Python**.


## Apparatus
* Used `vi` as editor
* All files compiled & tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* Used the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)

## Files
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-rectangle.py` | Empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle |
| `1-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its `width` and `height` |
| `2-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that has `area` and `permiter` methods |
| `3-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that counts with a string representation |
| `4-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that count with an official representation |
| `5-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that prints a message when an instance is deleted |
| `6-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` with a public class attribute that counts the number of instances |
| `7-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` with a public class attribute to print a specific symbol |
| `8-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` with a method to compare instance's size |
| `9-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` with a class method that returns a new instance|
| `101-nqueens.py` | `Backtracking` algorithm that solves the N-Queen puzzle |
